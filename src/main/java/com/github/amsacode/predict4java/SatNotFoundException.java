    predict4java: An SDP4 / SGP4 library for satellite orbit predictions

    Copyright (C)  2004-2010  David A. B. Johnson, G4DPZ.

    This class is a Java port of one of the core elements of
    the Predict program, Copyright John A. Magliacane,
    KD2BD 1991-2003: http://www.qsl.net/kd2bd/predict.html

    Dr. T.S. Kelso is the author of the SGP4/SDP4 orbital models,
    originally written in Fortran and Pascal, and released into the
    public domain through his website (http://www.celestrak.com/). 
    Neoklis Kyriazis, 5B4AZ, later re-wrote Dr. Kelso's code in C,
    and released it under the GNU GPL in 2002.
    PREDICT's core is based on 5B4AZ's code translation efforts.
